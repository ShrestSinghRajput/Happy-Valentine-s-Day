            <h1>To the Most Beautiful and Lovely(wierd,funniest but the cutest) Girlfriend ❤️ </h1>
            <h2>
              I'd like to start with how happy you make me feel in day to day life.
              How my day suddenly becomes better with just a call listening to your
              daily gossips, hearing you laugh and seeing you smile even for a split second.
              How seeing you on the screen being happy while eating desserts happily, lights up my
              whole mood and that is one of the most cherished memory I have of us on call.
              I miss you so much! I don’t mean to
              sound whiny or crazy, but I do with all my heart. And although I think that this day
              is much too hyped, I can’t help but miss you when I see all the
              cute things everyone else is doing today for their partners. Things would have
              turned out very differently if you were around or if we had been more lucky to be there offline. 
            </h2>
            <h2>
              I totally understand that the distance between us is just a silly
              number and that it is just a temporary thing that one day we'll overcome together.
              I don’t even want you to drop everything and give all your
              time to me and only me- but deep down a part of me  wishes you could. 
              It is probably very selfish of me to wish for
              something like that, and I feel silly and stupid for doing so. But there is
              this one part of me that wants to able to celebrate "My whole life as same as the
              Valentine's Day" with you.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              So what if we couldn’t celebrate Valentine’s Day together? It
              doesn’t define our relationship, does it? And it isn’t the end of
              time or youth, either! There’ll be many more Valentine’s Days to be
              celebrated with you, and everything will be alright.
              Besides, we don’t need a Valentine’s Day to tell each other how
              much we mean to each other.We are one, by hardwork, love and understanding
              each other not just with a tag of "Relationship". For us every day is
              normal and every single day we laugh, smile and make efforts for each other's
              happiness is a Valentine's Day🫂❤️
            </h2>
            <h2>
              I tried so hard to do the best that would have been possible for today,
              But I could not. Maybe due to my incapability, situations or maybe myself.
              But one thing is sure that I mean to give the whole world to you, every
              single thing that you like. Either it be the chocolates, the DIYs, the efforts,
              espacially tulips. Or maybe that real doll based castles, or whatever you ever
              wished for, I want to make each and every single thing  possible to make you
              happy. Maybe i'm not capable enough today, but One day for sure "I'll be"
              and then I promise each and every promise I ever made to you, will be fulfilled 🫂❤️
              The truth is that I miss you and I am
              waiting for the day I’ll get to see you and tell you how much I
              love you, in person! To hold hands with you, have a walk with you,
              hug you for a long hour just to be happy that at last we made it possible!
              Until then, I guess I’ll just have to be
              patient - which I am not able to be, but all we can do is, wait!
            </h2>

            <h2>
              Last but not the least, Happy Valentine’s Day, my little cupcake. Mera Baccha I
              love you so much, and I hope you know that. I miss you a lot and I hope this
              small try to  make you smile for a single split second would work(hopefully)
              There are walks and dates to go on, lots of silly
              things to be done, conversations about everything under the sun to
              be had. Can’t wait for you to be successful enough to come to me.🫂❤️
